CleanTalk protects your website from online threats. The CleanTalk Security and Firewall plugin protects your site from hacking attempts and provides a large set of tools for strengthening protection.

### Brute-force Protection
Adds a delay of few seconds for any failed attempt to login to WordPress back-end. Blocks any attempts from known bad IPs.
Service will check your security log once per hour and if some IP’s have 10 and more attempts to log in, then these IP’s will be banned for the next 24 hours. It makes your website security tougher and doesn’t waste the server’s resources on these IP’s.

### Security Report every 24 hours
Every day the plugin sends a Security report to your email. The report provides data on the number of incorrect password entries and the IP addresses from which the tried to sign in.

### Security FireWall to block access to your website by IP(Black & White Lists)
Security FireWall may significantly reduce the risk of hacking and reduces the load on your web server. Use personal BlackList to block IP addresses with a suspicious activity to enhance website security. To enhance the security of your site, you can use the Security FireWall, which allows you to block access to your website by HTTP/HTTPS for individual IP addresses or IP networks. 

### Security FireWall to block to access to your website by countries
Tightly blocks access to the site for blocked countries. At the same time, all requests to the site will be blocked and visitors from these countries will not be able to go to the site pages. A blocking page will be displayed to visitors. This type of blocking will be useful to prevent all types of attacks on the web site via HTTP / HTTPS. All types of blocked requests are logged and available in the Dashboard for further analysis.

### Usage of the CleanTalk Database of Dangerous IP Addresses
CleanTalk has its own database of IP addresses involved in attacks on other websites. The database is updated in real time. BlackIPs Database — is the database of the most active IP addresses where massive spam and brute force attacks come from. When IP starts attacking a few websites they are immediately added to the blacklist. IPs that stop attacking are being removed over time and that time is relatively short — usually about 2 weeks.

### Malware Scanner
Scan a website for malware to protects your website from viruses and deletes infected code from files. Security Malware Scanner runs manually in the settings and automatically once a day. All of the results will send in your CleanTalk Dashboard with the details and you will be able to investigate them and see if that was a legitimate change or some bad code was injected.

### Web Application Firewall
The main purpose of the Web Application FireWall is to protect the Web application from unauthorized access, even if there are critical vulnerabilities. Web Application Firewall catches all requests to your website and checks HTTP parameters that include: SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), uploading files from non-authorized users, PHP constructions/code, the presence of malicious code in the downloaded files.
